This project simulates the Simon Game.
The screen will show 4 colours in a square fashion and the user has to enter a key to start the game.
The game starts from Level 1 to all the way till the user chooses a wrong color.
One of the colors will flash and the user has to select that color.
After that another color will flash and the user has to select the color but in an order starting from the color which had flashed the first time.
Basically the user has to keep remembering the pattern of color selection as and when the colors keep flashing.
If a wrong color is chosen the screen will flash "GAME OVER" and the user has to restart the game from Level 1.
